<h3>Research question: How would the wetlands be effected by overflowing storm water systems in Duplin County, NC? <h3>
 <h3> In order to answer this question I first used the buffer function around the storm water systems. I wanted to see where the systems were and how much overflow space they would have if they overflow. I put a buffer of 100 ft around each system with the idea that if the storm water systems overflowed they wouldn't overflow more than 100 feet. After that I used the clip funtion to find where the buffered storm water systems and wetlands overlap. On my map, the red is the area where these two datasets overlap. There are very few places where they overlap which means that according to my research question, the wetlands would be upheld if the storm water systems overflowed.   </h3>
