    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>In order to display the map in 9 different projections I relied on the project properties function of QGIS. I typed in the projections that I was interested in finding and then applied them to my map. </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection shows the entire globe with the equator running horizontally through the center.  </h3>
    <a href=".//maps/EPSG Projection.png">
    <img src=".//maps/EPSG Projection.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has much for ocean space to the east and west side of the map. These areas are distorted as the circles get much bigger as you go out either east or west.  </h3>
    <a href=".//maps/Aitoff Projection.png">
    <img src=".//maps/Aitoff Projection.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>ESPG 3857 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection shows distorted sizes of countries. Greenland looks almost as big as the African continent on this projection which is not accurate. </h3>
     <a href=".//maps/EPSG 3857.png">
     <img src=".//maps/EPSG 3857.png" alt="3857" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>53018 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The winkel projection shows the north and south pole as being much larger than other projections. The circles closest to the north and south pole are quite large.  </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>54027 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection shows the globe from the angle looking at the North pole. The north and south pole are both extremely distorted. </h3>
     <a href=".//maps/Projection 54027.png">
     <img src=".//maps/Projection 54027.png" alt="54027" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>102016 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection shows a very distorted view of the north and south pole as well. It looks at the globe from the top of the sphere. The circles are very small in the middle and then get larger as they spread out to the sides.</h3>
     <a href=".//maps/Projection 102016.png">
     <img src=".//maps/Projection 102016.png" alt="102016" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>102023 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection shows a rectangular view of the globe. The south pole is very distorted as it looks like it has multiple layers. </h3>
     <a href=".//maps/Projection 102023.png">
     <img src=".//maps/Projection 102023.png" alt="102023" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>3410 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection shows a very elongated view of the globe. The continents looked stretched out and the south pole looks very flat.   </h3>
     <a href=".//maps/Projection 3410.png">
     <img src=".//maps/Projection 3410.png" alt="3410" width='500px'>
