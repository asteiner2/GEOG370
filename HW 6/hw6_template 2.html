<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Annabel Steiner</h2>
<h3>My map depicts the population of people on public health insurance within each county in North Carolina. Mecklenberg and Wake County both have the highest number of insured people which makes sense because those counties have higher populations due to Raleigh and Charlotte. Counties in the North East have low numbers of insured people. Those counties are more rural and are less populated so it makes sense that the numbers are lower.   </h3>
